# Computer Architecture Helper

I made this program in 2020 with C++ to solve exercises of the Computer Architecture subject and to be able to verify that my results are correct.

### The program solves step by step:

1. Conversion from decimal to binary.
2. Conversion of integers from base "n" to base "m".
3. Conversion from Decimal to IEEE-754 Single-Precision Binary
4. Addition and Subtraction in BCD

### Usage Guide:

Open the executable "ComputerArchitectureHelper.exe" and type the number of the option you want. Then the program will guide you to enter the required numbers and show you the result and the resolution step by step.
